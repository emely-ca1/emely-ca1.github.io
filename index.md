### CPSC 120

* Lab 4, part 1

    This lab was challenging for me at the time because I had to initialize and add values to functions that had to initialize other functions. It was really fun to figure out how math plays in c++ programming. This lab helped prepare me for future labs that also used math.

* Lab 7

    I really liked this lab because making the code to see if the hour, minute, street, and day were correct was really challenging but fun to do. Even though this lab took some time for me, it was worth it because it helped me understand bool functions. After this lab, bool functions were easier to understand and therefore, easier to code.

* Lab 11, part 1

    This lab was one of my favorites because it was the first lab where I was confident in my first editing of code. Figuring out how to calculate the densest state and the sparsest state was really interesting to do. It also helped me figure out how loops can help figure out these things so that it gets easier.
